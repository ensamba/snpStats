<h2>snpStats: Overview </h2>
This package extends the <tt>snpMatrix</tt> package, allowing uncertainty
in genotype assignments, for example as  consequence of imputation.
It provides most of the functionality of <tt>snpMatrix</tt>, although
it lacks some of the functions for importing genotype data from text
files in some formats (notably linkage pedfiles). It is intended that
the most important of
these will be provided in the very near future but, in the meantime, such
data can be read using <tt>snpMatrix</tt>, saved as R objects and then
converted into the equivalent <tt>snpStats</tt> objects. In addition, the
functions in <tt>snpMatrix</tt> for calculating linkage disequilibrium
statistics have been replaced by a single function in <tt>snpStats</tt>.
Note that imputation rules objects in
<tt>snpMatrix</tt> are not compatible with those used and must be regenerated.
For more details, see the "differences" vignette.

Further development of the <tt>snpMatrix</tt> project by this developer will
take place entirely within <tt>snpStats</tt>.
